1. Problem: Alternating Characters

You are given a string containing only characters A and B. You need to delete characters to make sure that no two same characters are adjacent.

Input: "AABAAB"
Output: 2

Explanation:
	•	Delete the second A and the fourth A → "ABAB" → no duplicates next to each other.


const duplicate = (str) => {
  const strarray = str.split("")
  let count = 0
  for (i = 0; i < strarray.length; i++) {
    if (strarray[i] == str[i + 1]) {
      count++
    }
  }
 return (count)
}
duplicate("AABAABBAAABBABABABAAABABAWAWW")
