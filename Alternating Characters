1. Problem: Alternating Characters

You are given a string containing only characters A and B. You need to delete characters to make sure that no two same characters are adjacent.

Input: "AABAAB"
Output: 2

Explanation:
	â€¢	Delete the second A and the fourth A â†’ "ABAB" â†’ no duplicates next to each other.


const duplicate = (str) => {
  const strarray = str.split("")
  let count = 0
  for (i = 0; i < strarray.length; i++) {
    if (strarray[i] == str[i + 1]) {
      count++
    }
  }
 return (count)
}
duplicate("AABAABBAAABBABABABAAABABAWAWW")

2. Problem: Two Strings

ðŸ“„ Description:

Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A single character is enough.

Input: "hello", "world"
Output: YES (they share l)

Input: "hi", "abc"
Output: NO


const commonst = (str1, str2) => {
  const set1 = new Set(str1)
  for (ch of str2) {
    if (set1.has(ch)) console.log(true)
    else false
  }
}
commonst("hello", "world")
