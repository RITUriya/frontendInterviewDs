11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

/**
 * @param {number[]} height

var maxArea = function (height) {
    let area = 0
    let w = 0
    let left = 0
    let right = height.length - 1
    let h = 0
    let max = 0
    while (left <= right) {
        h = Math.min(height[left], height[right])
        w = right - left;
        area = h * w;
        max = Math.max(max, area);
        if (height[left] < height[right]) left++
        else right--
    }
    return (max)
};
