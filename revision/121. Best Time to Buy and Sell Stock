You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

sol1:
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let maxp = 0;
  let profit = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    for (j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
      if (prices[i] > prices[j]) break;
      if (prices[i] == 0 && prices[j] == 0) break;
      profit = prices[j] - prices[i];
      maxp = Math.max(profit, maxp);
    }
  }
  return console.log(maxp);
};
maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]);
maxProfit([7, 6, 4, 3, 1]);
