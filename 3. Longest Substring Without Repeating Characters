3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


sol1:
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function (s) {
    let arr = []
    let max = 0

    for (let e of s) {
        if (arr.includes(e)) {
            arr = arr.splice(arr.indexOf(e) + 1)
        }

        arr.push(e)
        if (arr.length > max) {
            max = arr.length
        }
    } return max
};
